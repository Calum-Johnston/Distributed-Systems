Client connects to front end server (via stub)
Front End Server connects to a back end server (based on avaliability) (via stub)
Client makes requests to front end, which make request to back end

CLient invokes a method through front end server (fes connects to an available back end server and then does stuff, then close connection)


FLOW OF UPDATES:
- Periodically checks for updates

Questions?
- Does front end server choose a back end server for every request the client makes?
- If so, then even if multiple clients are connected only one thing can happen at once surely??
- Why bother with front end, why not just cut out middle man

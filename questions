We have three RM servers: 1, 2 and 3

Update 1, then 2, then 3

This means when gossiping, if we try to merge 3 into 1 we can't (as update 2 happened between), however we can merge 2 into 1 first, then 3 into 1.

How do I select order of collecting data to merge?


FIRST ATTEMPT: 
- When recieving data from all RM's, add all updates to the log first
- Then find stable updates and apply them
ISSUE == When looking for stable updates, some appear unstable until others have been applied. E.g. If update from 3 is seen before 2, it will not be applied. After this update from 2 will be applied and it is now possible 3 can be applied (however not until checked again)

So do I have to order the logs as well?

Easiest thing to do is order the logs, then do it all.
